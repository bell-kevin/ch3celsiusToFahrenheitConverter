# ch3celsiusToFahrenheitConverter
Write a program that asks the user for a Celsius temperature and converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula for this conversion is: Fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * Celsius + 32  Display the result with one decimal place and make sure the decimal point always displays. Run the program to match the example and take a screenshot. A Celsius temperature of 37 is 98.6 in Fahrenheit -- body temperature. Run the program with another temperature -- the freezing point (0) or the boiling point (100) -- and take a screenshot.  Ch 3 Celsius example     NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
